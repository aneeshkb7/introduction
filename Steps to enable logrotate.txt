#create a configuration file for your log directory at /etc/logrotate.d/filename

#eg:sudo subl /etc/logrotate.d/psql

#then copy the below code and paste it on the file and edit according to your need(# is comment) 
#----------------------------------------------------------

#begin

# Logrotate file for /var/log/postgresql/*.log       

/var/log/postgresql/*.log
{

#we need to specify the owner of the log file directory(/var/log/postgresql/*.log ) in this case it is root.
su root 


#indicates that only 3 rotated logs should be kept. Thus, the oldest file will be removed on the fourth subsequent
rotate 3   

#compress and delaycompress are used to tell that all rotated logs, with the exception of the most recent one,
#should be compressed.
compress   


#sets the minimum size for the rotation to take place to 10MB. In other words, each log will not be rotated until it 
#reaches 10MB.
size 10MB   


#weekly means that the tool will attempt to rotate the logs on a weekly basis. Other possible values are daily, 
#monthly, and hourly 
weekly   


#r=4 w=2 x=1 (owner group other ) ie: 640 means owner have rw permision(4+2) group have read permission(4) others have 
#no permission(0)
create 640 postgres postgres 


#After rotation if you have to perform anything use postrotate it is not mandatory and prerotate to perform 
#before logrotation  
postrotate  
echo "A Rotation just took place restarted postgres"   
sudo service postgresql restart   
endscript
}

#end
